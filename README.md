## 👁️ What is SparkEye?

**SparkEye** is an EdTech system that bridges the gap between digital theory and physical reality. While online education has mastered videos and quizzes, it often fails at teaching physical, real-world skills. 

SparkEye uses **camera-based AI vision** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to understand what students are building in real-time. Instead of just "watching and trying," students get a system that can observe, validate, and guide their physical work step-by-step.

## 🛠️ The Problem We're Solving

* **The "Watch and Try" Gap:** Most EdTech platforms cannot see if a student is actually wiring a circuit correctly.
* **Frustrating Learning Curves:** In subjects like electronics and robotics, one misplaced wire can lead to hours of frustration.
* **Lack of Scalability:** Hardware education typically requires a human mentor to verify physical builds, making it hard to scale for self-learners.

## 💡 The Solution

SparkEye transforms physical learning into a measurable, understood process:

* **Visual Verification:** Using AI computer vision, SparkEye captures a single image at key milestones to verify the build is correct before moving forward.
* **AR Integration:** Overlays highlight components, guide placement, and show real-time corrections directly on the student's physical setup.
* **Tight Feedback Loop:** Students receive instant, actionable feedback rather than waiting for a class or mentor.

## ✨ Key Features

1.  **Eliminate Guesswork:** No more "Is this pin right?" SparkEye confirms it for you.
2.  **24/7 Visual Tutor:** Learn hardware skills independently at any time without a human teacher.
3.  **Earned Progress:** The lesson only advances when the build is 100% accurate, discouraging superficial learning.
4.  **High Confidence, Low Pressure:** Quiet, private iteration allows learners to fail and retry until they succeed.
5.  **Measurable Progress:** Physical skills are transformed into trackable data and verifiable milestones.

## 🚀 Current Scope: Arduino

We are launching with **Arduino** support because it is the global entry point for hardware learning.

* **Hardware:** Arduino Uno + Breadboard.
* **Components:** LEDs, resistors, sensors, and jumpers.
* **Experience:** Step-by-step guided projects with per-step visual validation.

## 🔮 Future Expansion

SparkEye is evolving into a **universal visual tutor** for everyday skills:
* **Home Repair & DIY:** Guiding assembly and safety checks.
* **Cooking:** Verifying prep and technique.
* **Basic Electronics:** Moving beyond Arduino to advanced PCB work and appliance repair.

## 🗺️ Vision

SparkEye closes the biggest gap in online education: **the inability to see and understand physical learning.**

> **Today:** Arduino  
> **Tomorrow:** All hands-on education  
> **SparkEye doesn’t just teach students what to do—it sees what they do and helps them do it right.**
